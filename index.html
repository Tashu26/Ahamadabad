            <p id="headingPara">Ahmedabad ( Amdavad in Gujarati) is the largest city and former capital 
                of the Indian state of Gujarat. It is the administrative headquarters of the Ahmedabad district and the seat of the Gujarat 
                High Court. <br> Ahmedabad's population of 5,633,927 (as per 2011 population census) makes it the fifth-most populous city in India, 
                and the encompassing urban agglomeration population estimated at 6,357,693 is the seventh-most populous in India. <br> Ahmedabad 
                is located on the banks of the Sabarmati River, 23 km (14 mi) from the state capital Gandhinagar, which is its twin city<br>
                Ahmedabad has emerged as an important economic and industrial hub in India.  <br>It is the second-largest producer of cotton in India, 
                and its stock exchange is the country's second oldest. Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad. A newly built Sardar Patel Stadium 
                at Motera can accommodate 110,000 spectators.  <br>The effects of liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city's 
                economy towards tertiary sector activities such as commerce, communication and construction. Ahmedabad's increasing 
                population has resulted in an increase in the construction and housing industries resulting in recent development of 
                skyscrapers.<br> <br>

         <h1>History</h1> <hr><br> <br>
         <p>
            The area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, when it was known as Ashaval. At that time, Karna, the 
            Chaulukya ruler of Anhilwara (modern Patan), waged a successful war against the Bhil king of Ashaval, and established a city 
            called Karnavati on the banks of the Sabarmati<br>
            area finally came under the control of his grandson Sultan Ahmed Shah in 1411 A.D. who while at the banks of Sabarmati liked 
            the forested area for a new capital city and laid the foundation of a new walled city near Karnavati and named it Ahmedabad 
            after the four saints in the area by the name Ahmed. According to other sources, he named it after himself.  <br>
            Ahmed Shah I laid the foundation of the city on 26 February 1411 (at 1.20 pm, Thursday, the second day of Dhu al-Qi'dah, 
            Hijri year 813) at Manek Burj. He chose it as the new capital on 4 March 1411.<br> <br>

        Early in Ahmedabad's history, under Ahmed Shah, builders fused Hindu craftsmanship with Persian architecture, giving rise to the 
        Indo-Saracenic style. Many mosques in the city were built in this fashion. <br> Sidi Saiyyed Mosque was built in the last year 
        of the Sultanate of Gujarat. It is entirely arched and has ten stone latticework windows or jali on the side and rear arches. 
        Private mansions or haveli from this era have carvings. A Pol is a typical housing cluster of Old Ahmedabad.<br>
        After independence, modern buildings appeared in Ahmedabad. Architects given commissions in the city included Louis Kahn, <br>
         who designed the IIM-A; Le Corbusier, who designed the Shodhan and Sarabhai Villas, the Sanskar Kendra and the Mill 
         Owner's Association Building, and Frank Lloyd Wright, who designed the administrative building of Calico Mills and 
         the Calico Dome.<br>
        B. V. Doshi came to the city from Paris to supervise Le Corbusier's works and later set up the School of Architecture. 
        His local works include Sangath, Amdavad ni Gufa and the School of Architecture. <br> Charles Correa, who became a partner of Doshi's, 
        designed the Gandhi Ashram and Achyut Kanvinde, and the Indian Textile Industries Research Association. <br> Christopher 
        Charles Benninger's first work, the Alliance Française, is located in the Ellis Bridge area. Anant Raje designed major 
        additions to Louis Kahn's IIM-A campus, namely the Ravi Mathai Auditorium and KLMD.<br> <br>

        Environment
 </h1><hr> <br> <br>
    <p>Ahmedabad has a hot, semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh), with marginally less rain than required for a 
    tropical savanna climate. There are three main seasons: summer, monsoon and winter.  <br>Aside from the monsoon season, 
    the climate is extremely dry. The weather is hot from March to June; the average summer maximum is 43 °C (109 °F), 
    and the average minimum is 24 °C (75 °F). From November to February, <br> the average maximum temperature is 30 °C (86 °F), 
    the average minimum is 13 °C (55 °F), and the climate is extremely dry. Cold northerly winds are responsible for a mild chill in 
    January. The southwest monsoon brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid-September. <br> The average annual rainfall is about 
    800 millimetres (31 in), but infrequent heavy torrential rains cause local rivers to flood and it is not uncommon for droughts 
    to occur when the monsoon does not extend as far west as usual. The highest temperature in the city was recorded on 18 and 19 May 
    2016 which was 50 °C (122 °F).</p> <br> <br>

        Navratri
    </h1> <hr><br> <br>
    <p>Navaratri is a Hindu festival that spans nine nights (and ten days) and is celebrated every year in the autumn. It is observed for 
        different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Indian cultural sphere.  <br>Theoretically, there are four 
        seasonal Navaratri. However, in practice, it is the post-monsoon autumn festival called Sharada Navaratri that is the most observed 
        in the honor of the divine feminine Devi (Durga).  <br>The festival is celebrated in the bright half of the Hindu calendar month Ashvin, 
        which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October.<br>
        Navaratri in Gujarat is one of the state's main festivals. The traditional celebrations include fasting for a day, or partially 
        each of the nine days such as by not eating grains or just taking liquid foods, <br> in remembrance of one of nine aspects of Shakti 
        goddess. The prayers are dedicated to a symbolic clay pot called garbo, as a remembrance of the womb of the family and universe. 
        The clay pot is lit, and this is believed to represent the one Atman (soul, self).<br>
        In Gujarat and nearby Hindu communities such as in Malwa, the garbo significance is celebrated through performance arts on all nine 
        days. The most visible is group dances from villages to towns called Garba accompanied by live orchestra,  <br>seasonal raga or 
        devotional songs. It is a folk dance, where people of different background and skills join and form concentric circles.<br>
        The circles can grow or shrink, reaching sizes of hundreds, sometimes thousands of people, dancing and clapping in circular moves, 
        in their traditional costumes, at the same time. The garba dance sometimes deploys dandiyas (sticks), <br> coordinated movements and 
        striking of sticks between the dancers, and teasing between the genders. <br> Post dancing, the group and the audience socializes 
        and feasts together.Regionally, the same thematic celebration of community songs, music and dances on Navaratri 
        is called garbi or garabi.<br></p> <br> <br>
